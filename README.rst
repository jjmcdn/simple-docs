Simple Docs
===========

This is just a home for my example files for using documentation tools that I'd
otherwise forget about.  ReST is great for producing good looking ODT / MS Word
documents or PDFs from ascii-formatted text files (just like this one).

Pinpoint is in some ways much less powerful that OOImpress or MS Powerpoint, but
in other ways it's a lot more powerful.  At the end of the day, though, the
markup required for presentations using it is not much more than the markup
required for ReST files and the results are undeniably impressive.  I cannot
imagine I'll be creating presenatations in anything other than pinpoint from
now on.

I'll keep this updated as I find new tools.
