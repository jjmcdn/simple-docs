Use Case
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal Execution Flow
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A numbered list of steps for the use case.  Detailed instructions, explanation
of what is happening at each step and, where appropriate, examples that can
either be pasted directly into a command line or copied making obvious
substitutions for the user environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternate Execution Flow (detail)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each alternate scenario, an alternate execution flow section should exist,
titled appropriately, showing deviations from the `Normal Execution Flow`_
section above.

========================================================================
Postconditions
========================================================================
After this use case has been completed, what state is host and/or target system
in and what can and cannot be done with it?

========================================================================
Resources and Notes
========================================================================
A section pointing at any external sources of information, essential reading
(which should be referenced in the `Preconditions and Assumptions`_ section
above) or supporting documentation as well as any warnings or advice for common
failure situations.  Note that the use of footnotes [#sample_link]_ throughout
the text can be useful for providing context or clarification [#clarification]_
without interrupting the flow of the use-case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Links
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Links to internal or external resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abbreviations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abbreviations can be handled as full-replacements throughout the text if done
with a construct like this:

.. |abbv| replace:: abbreviation

Becomes |abbv| when expanded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra context not directly relevant to the use case but which may be important
when demonstrating this case to others.

.. [#clarification] A simple footnote containing an aside or a comment about possible output variations could prove helpful but interrupt the flow of the use case.
